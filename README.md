# Campus-Navigation-System
Campus Navigation Platform - Finding Shortest Path is a C++ project that uses graph algorithms like Dijkstra's and Bellman-Ford to calculate the shortest route between campus locations. It features an interactive interface and visualizes paths using ArcMap 10.8, combining algorithms with practical navigation solutions.
